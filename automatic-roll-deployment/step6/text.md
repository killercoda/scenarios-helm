In this step, you will verify that deployment rollout is done automatically

Upgrade the release to use the message `You successfully automatic rollout deployment!` instead of the previous one.

<br>

```plain
kubectl get cm -n dev-ns -l app=mock-app -ojsonpath='{.items[0].data}' && printf "\n"
```{{exec}}
The message value is updated with: "You successfully automatic rollout deployment!".
</details>

<details><summary>Verify the content of the deployed container</summary>
